# Networks

rrelayer supports any EVM chain out the box. You can config this really easily. Alongside it allows some additional nice features
which we talk about a little later.

## Fields

### name

This is the name of the network it can be anything its YOUR name of it

```yaml [rrelayer.yaml]
name: first-rrelayer
description: "my first rrelayer"
api_config:
  port: 3000
  authentication_username: ${RRELAYER_AUTH_USERNAME}
  authentication_password: ${RRELAYER_AUTH_PASSWORD}
signing_provider:
  aws_kms:
    region: "eu-west-1"
networks: // [!code focus]
- name: "sepolia_ethereum" // [!code focus]
```

### chain_id

This is the chain id for the network

```yaml [rrelayer.yaml]
name: first-rrelayer
description: "my first rrelayer"
api_config:
  port: 3000
  authentication_username: ${RRELAYER_AUTH_USERNAME}
  authentication_password: ${RRELAYER_AUTH_PASSWORD}
signing_provider:
  aws_kms:
    region: "eu-west-1"
networks: // [!code focus]
- name: "sepolia_ethereum"
  chain_id: 11155111 # [!code focus]
```

### provider_urls

This is rpc urls for your network which rrelayer will use to send transactions and also monitor transactions.
It can accept an array of providers and will randomly load balance through them if you put more then 1.

```yaml [rrelayer.yaml]
name: first-rrelayer
description: "my first rrelayer"
api_config:
  port: 3000
  authentication_username: ${RRELAYER_AUTH_USERNAME}
  authentication_password: ${RRELAYER_AUTH_PASSWORD}
signing_provider:
  aws_kms:
    region: "eu-west-1"
networks: // [!code focus]
- name: "sepolia_ethereum"
  chain_id: 11155111
  provider_urls: // [!code focus]
  - "https://sepolia.gateway.tenderly.co" // [!code focus]
  block_explorer_url: "https://sepolia.etherscan.io"
```

### block_explorer_url - optional

This is the block explorer url - it will come back in network info but is not required

```yaml [rrelayer.yaml]
name: first-rrelayer
description: "my first rrelayer"
api_config:
  port: 3000
  authentication_username: ${RRELAYER_AUTH_USERNAME}
  authentication_password: ${RRELAYER_AUTH_PASSWORD}
signing_provider:
  aws_kms:
    region: "eu-west-1"
networks: // [!code focus]
- name: "sepolia_ethereum"
  chain_id: 11155111
  provider_urls:
  - "https://sepolia.gateway.tenderly.co"
  block_explorer_url: "https://sepolia.etherscan.io" // [!code focus]
```

### max_gas_price_multiplier - default 4

rrelayer will bump up prices after n numbers of blocks depending on what transaction speed you sent it as,
with that it could end up on huge spikes trying to bump it a very high amount. The idea with this is rrelayer
will never send a transaction more then 4x greater then the fastest gas price we have from our gas providers.
You can change this to say 1000 if you wish to never care about max gas cost. Note each relayer can have its own
config for max gas price which you can read more about [here](/integration/sdk/relayers/node#update-max-gas-price)

```yaml [rrelayer.yaml]
name: first-rrelayer
description: "my first rrelayer"
api_config:
  port: 3000
  authentication_username: ${RRELAYER_AUTH_USERNAME}
  authentication_password: ${RRELAYER_AUTH_PASSWORD}
signing_provider:
  aws_kms:
    region: "eu-west-1"
networks: // [!code focus]
- name: "sepolia_ethereum"
  chain_id: 11155111
  provider_urls:
  - "https://sepolia.gateway.tenderly.co"
  block_explorer_url: "https://sepolia.etherscan.io"
  max_gas_price_multiplier: 4 # [!code focus]
```

### confirmations - optional default 12

This is how many confirmations it will wait to mark it as CONFIRMED this will still mark it as MINED asap and normally
applications consider it done after that

```yaml [rrelayer.yaml]
name: first-rrelayer
description: "my first rrelayer"
api_config:
  port: 3000
  authentication_username: ${RRELAYER_AUTH_USERNAME}
  authentication_password: ${RRELAYER_AUTH_PASSWORD}
signing_provider:
  aws_kms:
    region: "eu-west-1"
networks: // [!code focus]
- name: "sepolia_ethereum"
  chain_id: 11155111
  provider_urls:
  - "https://sepolia.gateway.tenderly.co"
  block_explorer_url: "https://sepolia.etherscan.io"
  max_gas_price_multiplier: 4
  confirmations: 2 # [!code focus]
```

### enable_sending_blobs - optional

When blobs are enabled it does additional RPC lookups for the blob gas oracles so you can disable it by setting this to false

```yaml [rrelayer.yaml]
name: first-rrelayer
description: "my first rrelayer"
api_config:
  port: 3000
  authentication_username: ${RRELAYER_AUTH_USERNAME}
  authentication_password: ${RRELAYER_AUTH_PASSWORD}
signing_provider:
  aws_kms:
    region: "eu-west-1"
networks: // [!code focus]
- name: "sepolia_ethereum"
  chain_id: 11155111
  provider_urls:
  - "https://sepolia.gateway.tenderly.co"
  block_explorer_url: "https://sepolia.etherscan.io"
  max_gas_price_multiplier: 4
  enable_sending_blobs: false # [!code focus]
```

### signing_provider - optional

In all our examples we map the signing_provider to the main project, but you can override it in the network itself.
This follows all the same YAML style as the signing provider logic but within the network's object. You can find all
the documentation in the signer provider pages:

- [KMS](/config/signing-providers/aws-kms)
- [AWS Secret Manager](/config/signing-providers/aws-secret-manager)
- [GCP Secret Manager](/config/signing-providers/gcp-secret-manager)
- [Raw Mnemonic](/config/signing-providers/raw-mnemonic)
- [Privy](/config/signing-providers/privy)
- [Turnkey](/config/signing-providers/turnkey)
- [Fireblocks](/config/signing-providers/fireblocks)
- [Private Keys](/config/signing-providers/private-keys)
- [PKCS11 Beta](/config/signing-providers/pkcs11)

### allowed_random_relayers - optional

Controls which relayers are eligible for selection when using the random relayer endpoint.
If not specified, all available relayers can be selected (equivalent to `"*"`).

**Options:**
- `"*"` - Allow all relayers (default behavior)
- Single address - Only allow one specific relayer for random selection
- Array of addresses - Allow only the specified relayers for random selection

```yaml [rrelayer.yaml]
name: first-rrelayer
description: "my first rrelayer"
api_config:
  port: 3000
  authentication_username: ${RRELAYER_AUTH_USERNAME}
  authentication_password: ${RRELAYER_AUTH_PASSWORD}
signing_provider:
  aws_kms:
    region: "eu-west-1"
networks: // [!code focus]
- name: "sepolia_ethereum"
  chain_id: 11155111
  provider_urls:
  - "https://sepolia.gateway.tenderly.co"
  block_explorer_url: "https://sepolia.etherscan.io"
  allowed_random_relayers: ["0x742f0677b50b0F1C2151865Dcb98BF32FeaF65c9"] # [!code focus]
```

**Examples:**

Allow all relayers (default):
```yaml
allowed_random_relayers: "*"
```

Allow only specific relayers:
```yaml
allowed_random_relayers: 
  - "0x742f0677b50b0F1C2151865Dcb98BF32FeaF65c9"
  - "0x8ba1f109551bD432803012645Hac136c6d3A60E7"
```

Allow single relayer:
```yaml
allowed_random_relayers: "0x742f0677b50b0F1C2151865Dcb98BF32FeaF65c9"
```
