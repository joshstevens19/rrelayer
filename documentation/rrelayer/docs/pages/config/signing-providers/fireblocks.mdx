# Fireblocks

Fireblocks is an enterprise-grade digital asset infrastructure platform that provides secure custody, transfer, and settlement of digital assets. It offers institutional-grade security through its proprietary Multi-Party Computation (MPC) technology, which eliminates single points of failure by distributing cryptographic operations across multiple parties. The platform provides comprehensive wallet management, transaction orchestration, and compliance tools designed for institutional users, including banks, exchanges, and fintech companies. Fireblocks integrates with hundreds of exchanges, DeFi protocols, and market makers, offering a unified interface for managing digital asset operations across multiple blockchains.

You can read more about Fireblocks [here](https://www.fireblocks.com/platforms/).

This guide will just talk about how you configure the signing provider and not go into depth of the setup on the Fireblocks console.

:::warning
We recommend creating dedicated vault accounts for RRelayer usage and not mixing them with other applications. This ensures proper isolation and easier management of your relayer operations.

## API Credentials Setup

Before configuring RRelayer, you need to set up API credentials in your Fireblocks workspace:

1. **Create API User**: In the Fireblocks console, create a new API user with appropriate permissions
2. **Generate API Key**: Download your API key and private key file
3. **Set Permissions**: Ensure the API user has permissions to:
   - Create and manage vault accounts
   - Create assets within vault accounts
   - Initiate and sign raw signature operations
   - View transaction status and details

## Usage

To enable Fireblocks you need to add the `api_key`, `private_key_path`, `identity`, and optionally `sandbox` in the YAML under the `fireblocks` key:

### Fields

#### api_key

Your Fireblocks API key obtained from the Fireblocks console.

```yaml [rrelayer.yaml]
name: first-rrelayer
description: "my first rrelayer"
api_config:
  port: 3000
  authentication_username: ${RRELAYER_AUTH_USERNAME}
  authentication_password: ${RRELAYER_AUTH_PASSWORD}
signing_provider: // [!code focus]
  fireblocks: // [!code focus]
    api_key: "${FIREBLOCKS_API_KEY}" // [!code focus]
```

#### private_key_path

The absolute path to your Fireblocks private key file. This file is downloaded when you create your API credentials.

```yaml [rrelayer.yaml]
name: first-rrelayer
description: "my first rrelayer"
api_config:
  port: 3000
  authentication_username: ${RRELAYER_AUTH_USERNAME}
  authentication_password: ${RRELAYER_AUTH_PASSWORD}
signing_provider: // [!code focus]
  fireblocks: // [!code focus]
    api_key: "${FIREBLOCKS_API_KEY}"
    private_key_path: "./fireblocks_secret.key"  // [!code focus]
```

#### identity (required)

A unique identifier for this rrelayer instance. This identity is used to namespace vault account names, allowing multiple rrelayer instances to use the same Fireblocks workspace without conflicts.

The identity is combined with chain ID and wallet index to create unique vault account names like `rrelayer-{identity}-wallet-{chain_id}-{wallet_index}`.

```yaml [rrelayer.yaml]
name: first-rrelayer
description: "my first rrelayer"
api_config:
  port: 3000
  authentication_username: ${RRELAYER_AUTH_USERNAME}
  authentication_password: ${RRELAYER_AUTH_PASSWORD}
signing_provider: // [!code focus]
  fireblocks: // [!code focus]
    api_key: "${FIREBLOCKS_API_KEY}"
    private_key_path: "./fireblocks_secret.key"
    identity: "prod-relay-01" // [!code focus]
```

#### sandbox (optional)

Whether to use the Fireblocks sandbox environment for testing. Defaults to `false` (production). Set to `true` for sandbox testing.

```yaml [rrelayer.yaml]
name: first-rrelayer
description: "my first rrelayer"
api_config:
  port: 3000
  authentication_username: ${RRELAYER_AUTH_USERNAME}
  authentication_password: ${RRELAYER_AUTH_PASSWORD}
signing_provider: // [!code focus]
  fireblocks: // [!code focus]
    api_key: "${FIREBLOCKS_SANDBOX_API_KEY}"
    private_key_path: "./fireblocks_secret.key"
    identity: "sandbox-test"
    sandbox: true # [!code focus]
```

#### hidden_on_ui (optional)

Whether to hide the created vault accounts from the Fireblocks console UI. Defaults to `true` to reduce UI clutter as well as
they are programmatic so you do not want others to use/edit them.

```yaml [rrelayer.yaml]
name: first-rrelayer
description: "my first rrelayer"
api_config:
  port: 3000
  authentication_username: ${RRELAYER_AUTH_USERNAME}
  authentication_password: ${RRELAYER_AUTH_PASSWORD}
signing_provider: // [!code focus]
  fireblocks: // [!code focus]
    api_key: "${FIREBLOCKS_API_KEY}"
    private_key_path: "./fireblocks_secret.key"
    identity: "prod-relay-01"
    hidden_on_ui: false # [!code focus]
```

## Complete Configuration Example

```yaml [rrelayer.yaml]
name: production-rrelayer
description: 'Production rrelayer with Fireblocks'
api_config:
  port: 3000
  authentication_username: ${RRELAYER_AUTH_USERNAME}
  authentication_password: ${RRELAYER_AUTH_PASSWORD}
signing_provider: # [!code focus]
  fireblocks: # [!code focus]
    api_key: '${FIREBLOCKS_API_KEY}' # [!code focus]
    private_key_path: "./fireblocks_secret.key" # [!code focus]
    identity: 'prod-relay-01' # [!code focus]
    sandbox: false # [!code focus]
    hidden_on_ui: true # [!code focus]
```

You then need to add the Fireblocks credentials to your `.env` file:

```bash
FIREBLOCKS_API_KEY=YOUR_FIREBLOCKS_API_KEY
# For sandbox testing
FIREBLOCKS_SANDBOX_API_KEY=YOUR_FIREBLOCKS_SANDBOX_API_KEY
```

:::warning
Store sensitive credentials in environment variables rather than hardcoding them in the configuration file. Ensure your private key file has appropriate file permissions (600) and is not accessible to unauthorized users.

## Vault Account Management

The Fireblocks provider automatically:

- Creates dedicated vault accounts for each wallet index and chain ID combination
- Names vault accounts using the pattern `rrelayer-{identity}-wallet-{chain_id}-{wallet_index}`
- Creates appropriate assets within vault accounts for each supported blockchain
- Maintains a cache mapping between wallet indices, chain IDs, and vault account details
- Ensures vault accounts are unique per chain and wallet combination to prevent cross-chain operations

Vault accounts are created on-demand when first accessed and remain available for subsequent use. The identity field ensures multiple rrelayer instances can safely share the same Fireblocks workspace without vault account conflicts.

## Security Considerations

:::warning
Ensure your Fireblocks workspace is properly configured with appropriate access controls, transaction policies, and approval workflows. The security of your funds depends on the proper configuration of your Fireblocks workspace and API permissions.
:::

- All private key operations are performed within Fireblocks' secure infrastructure
- Multi-Party Computation (MPC) eliminates single points of failure
- Transaction policies can enforce additional approval requirements (this enhancement may break rrelayer usage)
- Comprehensive audit logging is available through the Fireblocks console
- API access can be restricted by IP address and time-based rules

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**API authentication failed**: Verify your API key and private key file are correct and the API user has appropriate permissions.

**Unsupported chain ID**: Confirm the blockchain network you're trying to use is supported by both RRelayer and Fireblocks.

**Vault account creation failed**: Check that your API user has permissions to create vault accounts and assets.

**Transaction signing timeout**: Large transaction volumes or network congestion may cause signing operations to take longer. The implementation waits up to 15 seconds for signature completion.

**Asset not found**: Ensure the chain ID maps to a valid Fireblocks asset ID and that your workspace supports the required asset.

### Testing with Sandbox

For development and testing purposes, you can use the Fireblocks sandbox environment:

```yaml [sandbox-config.yaml]
signing_provider:
  fireblocks:
    api_key: '${FIREBLOCKS_SANDBOX_API_KEY}'
    private_key_path: './fireblocks_sandbox_secret.key'
    identity: 'sandbox-test'
    sandbox: true
    hidden_on_ui: false
```

:::warning
Always test your configuration in the sandbox environment before deploying to production. Sandbox and production environments have separate API credentials and vault accounts.
