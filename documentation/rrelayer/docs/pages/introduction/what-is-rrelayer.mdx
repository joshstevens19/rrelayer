# What is rrelayer?

:::info
Note rrelayer is actively under development, things will change, and bugs will exist—if you find any bugs or have any
feature requests, please open an issue on [github](https://github.com/joshstevens19/rrelayer/issues).
:::

rrelayer is an opensource powerful, high-performance blockchain transaction relay service built in Rust, designed for seamless integration with any EVM-compatible network.
This tool transforms complex blockchain interactions into simple REST API calls, eliminating the need for applications to manage wallets, transaction queuing, or nonce management.
For rrelayer supports advanced wallet infrastructure supporting multiple signing providers including AWS KMS hardware security modules, Turnkey self-custody solutions, Privy managed wallets, AWS Secrets Manager, GCP Secret Manager, and raw mnemonic development setups.
It's highly scalable and production-ready, enabling you to build robust Web3 applications with reliability and focus exclusively on your business logic.
rrelayer has some super cool out-of-the-box features, like automatic top-ups (with safe support), permissions config including allowlists, API keys with restricted access,
webhooks, rate limiting, and the ability to configure the gas bump blocks.

## Features

- Config Driven: Define everything in a simple rrelayer.yaml file, making it easy to turn on and off features
- Multi-Chain Support: Supports all EVM networks
- Transaction Relaying: Submit transactions to supported blockchain networks efficiently.
- Transaction Signing: Securely sign transactions using many of the signing providers.
- Transaction Fee Estimation: Estimate transaction fees for better cost management.
- Transaction Nonce Management: Handle nonce management to ensure transaction order.
- Transaction Status Monitoring: Track the status of submitted transactions.
- Transaction/Signing History: See all the transactions signed by the relayer or messages signed with a deep audit log
- SDK Integration: Integrate easily with our JS/TS API or rust API or
- Exposed API: If the SDK is not supported, you can just hit the API directly
- Extensible Architecture: Easily add support for new blockchain networks with a config update.
- Configurable Network Policies: Define and enforce network-specific policies for transaction processing.
- Automated top-ups: Build in background tasks to automatically top up relayers when gas or token funds are becoming low, with safe proxy support.
- Permissions: Add contract/addresses allowlists to relayers and turn on and off if they can sign messages, typed data, send transactions, and send native ETH.
- API Keys: Built-in API keys for relayers to allow you to give access to a system without giving access to every part of the rrelayer
- Webhooks: Notifications built in get notified of the transaction's status every step of the way or if balances are low.
- Rate Limiting: Built-in rate limiting allowing you to rate limit user transactions allowance by just updating the rrelayer.yaml
- Flexibility: No hard constraints on features like you can config how often it bumps gas depending on your need. Maybe a liquidation bot may want to bump every block for example.
- CLI: rrelayer is CLI first, so you can do everything with the command line tool.
- Full transactions support: rrelayer can send blob transactions and any kind of EVM transaction.

## What can I use rrelayer for?

- DApp backends: Handle user transactions without wallet management complexity
- NFT platforms: Automated minting, transfers, and marketplace operations with reliable execution
- DeFi protocols: Yield farming automation, liquidation bots, and cross-chain operations
- Enterprise Web3: Simplified blockchain integration for traditional businesses with audit compliance
- Development workflows: Consistent APIs for local development and comprehensive E2E testing
- Gasless transactions: Meta-transaction infrastructure for improved user experience
- Multi-chain applications: Unified transaction interface across different EVM networks
- High-frequency operations: Advanced queuing system for batch processing and optimization
- Production infrastructure: Enterprise-grade transaction reliability with comprehensive monitoring
- Loads more stuff like liquidation bot or trading bots etc

## What signing providers do you support?

rrelayer offers comprehensive wallet management through multiple secure signing providers to meet various security and operational requirements:

**Signing providers:**

- **AWS KMS**: Hardware security modules with enterprise-grade key protection, automatic key creation, and full EIP-4844 blob transaction support
- **AWS Secrets Manager**: Secure mnemonic storage with encrypted at-rest protection and IAM access control
- **GCP Secret Manager**: Google Cloud-based secret storage with service account authentication and cross-project access
- **Privy**: Managed wallet infrastructure with social login onboarding and API-based key management
- **Turnkey**: Self-custody solution with institutional features, cryptographic API authentication, and comprehensive audit trails
- **Raw Mnemonic**: Simple development setup using BIP39 mnemonics with HD wallet derivation for testing environments

All providers support transaction signing, message signing, and EIP-712 typed data signing.
Most providers support EIP-4844 blob transactions except Privy. Choose based on your security requirements.

## What networks do you support?

rrelayer supports any EVM-compatible network out of the box including Ethereum mainnet, L2 solutions like Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, testnets, and private networks.
If you have a custom EVM chain, you can easily add support by configuring the RPC endpoint and chain ID in the `rrelayer.yaml`.
No code changes are required, making it truly universal for the entire Ethereum ecosystem.
